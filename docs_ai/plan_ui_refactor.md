# Pymodoro UI Refactoring Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive refactoring plan for the Pymodoro Terminal User Interface (TUI). The current implementation in `src/pymodoro/interface.py` is a monolithic 350+ line class that handles all UI concerns. This refactoring will create a modular, maintainable, and extensible architecture while preserving all existing functionality.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Implementation
- **File**: `src/pymodoro/interface.py`
- **Main Class**: `PomodoroUI`
- **Dependencies**: Rich library for TUI components, timer module for session management
- **Key Features**: 
  - Main timer display with tomato ASCII art
  - Progress bar visualization
  - Help screen overlay
  - Confirmation dialogs for actions
  - State-based color theming
  - Caching for performance optimization

### Current Problems
1. **Single Responsibility Violation**: One class handles rendering, state management, caching, and layout
2. **Magic Numbers**: Hard-coded dimensions (width=12, width=40, width=60, etc.) scattered throughout
3. **Tight Coupling**: Components are tightly bound to session_info dictionary structure
4. **Limited Extensibility**: Adding new screens or components requires modifying the main class
5. **Embedded Configuration**: Visual styling mixed with business logic
6. **Code Duplication**: Similar rendering patterns repeated across methods

### Current Strengths to Preserve
- Clean component-based rendering approach
- Effective use of Rich library
- Good visual design and user experience
- Performance optimization through caching
- Consistent session state management

## Proposed Architecture

### Design Principles
1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles one specific aspect
2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build complex screens from simple components
3. **Configuration Over Code**: Make visual aspects configurable
4. **Single Source of Truth**: Centralize related functionality
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain existing public API

### Module Structure

└── interface.py         # Refactored main interface (facade)
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (High Priority)

#### Task 1.1: Analyze Dependencies
**Objective**: Understand the current timer interface and session management
**Actions**:
- Review `src/pymodoro/timer.py` to understand SessionType enum and timer interface
- Document the timer API that UI components will consume
- Identify all timer properties and methods used by the current UI

#### Task 1.2: Create Theme System (`theme.py`)
**Objective**: Centralize all visual styling and theming
**Requirements**:
- Extract all color definitions from current interface
- Create theme classes for different session states (work, short break, long break, paused)
- Move ASCII art constants to theme system
- Support configurable dimensions and spacing
- Provide color palette for consistent styling

**Key Components**:
- `SessionTheme` class with colors, styles, and icons
- `ThemeManager` for switching between themes
- Constants for ASCII art (TOMATO_ART, BREAK_TOMATO_ART, PAUSE_TOMATO_ART)
- Dimension constants (panel widths, bar widths, etc.)

#### Task 1.3: Create Component System (`components.py`)
**Objective**: Build reusable UI components that can be composed into screens
**Requirements**:
- Extract all rendering logic from current interface
- Create composable components with clean interfaces
- Implement consistent error handling and fallbacks
- Support theme integration

**Key Components**:
- `TimerDisplay`: Renders time in MM:SS format with configurable styling
- `ProgressBar`: Configurable progress visualization with customizable appearance
- `Header`: Session status, titles, and pause indicators
- `ArtDisplay`: ASCII art renderer with theme support
- `Dialog`: Reusable modal dialog system for confirmations and help
- `StatusInfo`: Session information display component

### Phase 2: Screen Management (Medium Priority)

#### Task 2.1: Create Layout System (`layout.py`)
**Objective**: Provide flexible positioning and sizing utilities
**Requirements**:
- Grid-based layout system for consistent positioning
- Responsive sizing helpers that adapt to terminal size
- Alignment and spacing utilities
- Support for centered and aligned content

**Key Components**:
- `LayoutGrid`: Grid system for component positioning
- `Dimensions`: Utility class for calculating sizes
- `Alignment`: Helpers for centering and positioning
- `Spacing`: Consistent spacing and padding utilities

#### Task 2.2: Create Screen Management (`screens.py`)
**Objective**: Manage different screens and their transitions
**Requirements**:
- Base screen class with common functionality
- Specific screen implementations
- Screen state management and transitions
- Modal overlay support

**Key Components**:
- `Screen`: Abstract base class for all screens
- `MainScreen`: Primary timer interface using components
- `HelpScreen`: Help overlay screen
- `ConfirmationScreen`: Modal confirmation dialogs
- `ScreenManager`: Coordinate screen transitions and overlay management

### Phase 3: Integration (High Priority)

#### Task 3.1: Refactor Main Interface (`interface.py`)
**Objective**: Transform existing interface into a thin facade
**Requirements**:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Coordinate between new modules
- Simplify caching and state management
- Preserve all existing functionality

**Key Changes**:
- Replace monolithic class with component coordination
- Use new theme and component systems
- Integrate screen management
- Maintain existing `get_renderable()` method signature

#### Task 3.2: Testing and Validation
**Objective**: Ensure refactored system maintains all functionality
**Requirements**:
- Verify all screens render correctly
- Test screen transitions and overlays
- Validate performance is maintained or improved
- Ensure no regression in user experience

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Follow existing project conventions (PEP 8, type hints, docstrings)
- Use absolute imports as specified in CLAUDE.md
- Add file location comments to all new files
- Maintain consistent error handling patterns

### Error Handling
- Implement graceful degradation for rendering errors
- Provide meaningful fallbacks for theme or component failures
- Log errors appropriately without disrupting user experience

### Performance Considerations
